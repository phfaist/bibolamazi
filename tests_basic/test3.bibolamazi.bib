We introduce a novel resolution measure, which provides 'error bars' for any inferred quantity of interest.

We show that such diagnostics is meaningful only when a lot of prior information on the measured quantum state is available. Our resolution measure also provides an effective tool for optimization and resolution tuning of tomography schemes.",

    abstract = "Conservation of energy implies that we cannot freely create superpositions between energy eigenstates, while access to coherence enables such processes. A simple example of the latter is when an atom is put into a superposition of two energy levels, using coherent radiation in form of a laser. The question is to what extent the coherence is degraded when utilized. Here we show that coherence can be turned into a catalytic resource, meaning that it can be used indefinitely to induce coherent operations without ever being degraded. As an application we consider quantum thermodynamics, where we demonstrate that access to sufficient coherence enables the release of all latent expected work content in a system. Since we can make it a catalyst, no coherence is spent to achieve this work extraction. In a wider perspective, the fact that coherence can be made catalytic provides a step towards a characterization of the relation between energy and coherence as resources in quantum statistical mechanics.",

This serves as a basis for the Landauer principle, which puts a lower bound Tln2 for the heat generated by erasure of one bit of information. Here we show that in the world of quantum entanglement this law is broken. A quantum Brownian particle interacting with its thermal bath can either generate less heat or even absorb heat during an analogous squeezing process, due to entanglement with the bath. The effect exists even for weak but fixed coupling with the bath, provided that temperature is low enough. This invalidates the Landauer bound in the quantum regime, and suggests that quantum carriers of information can be more efficient than assumed so far.",

A consequence is Landauer’s erasure principle, which states that the erasure of one bit of information requires a minimum energy cost equal to kT ln(2), where T is the temperature of a thermal reservoir used in the process and k is Boltzmann’s constant. Jaynes, however, argued that the maximum entropy principle could be applied to any number of conserved quantities, which would suggest that information erasure may have alternative costs. Indeed, we showed recently that by using a reservoir comprising energy degenerate spins and subject to conservation of angular momentum, the cost of information erasure is in terms of angular momentum rather than energy. Here, we extend this analysis and derive the minimum cost of information erasure for systems where different conservation laws operate. We find that, for each conserved quantity, the minimum resource needed to erase one bit of memory is $\lambda$-1 ln(2), where $\lambda$ is related to the average value of the conserved quantity. The costs of erasure depend, fundamentally, on both the nature of the physical memory element and the reservoir with which it is coupled.",

We present a pedagogical introduction to the debate in the form of a hypothetical dialogue between proponents from each of the two camps: a factist and a fictionist. A resolution of the debate can be achieved, we argue, by recognizing that quantum states do not only contain information about the intrinsic properties of a system but about its extrinsic properties as well, that is, about its relation to other systems external to it. Specifically, the coherent quantum state of the factist is the appropriate description of the relation of the system to one reference frame, while the incoherent quantum state of the fictionist is the appropriate description of the relation of the system to another, uncorrelated, reference frame. The two views, we conclude, are alternative but equally valid paradigms of description.",

We adopt an operational measure of a reference frame's longevity, namely, the number of measurements that can be made against it with a certain error tolerance. We investigate two distinct types of reference frame: a reference direction, realized by a spin-j system, and a phase reference, realized by an oscillator mode with bounded energy. For both cases, we show that our measure of longevity increases quadratically with the size of the reference system and is therefore non-additive. For instance, the number of measurements that a directional reference frame consisting of N parallel spins can be put to use scales as N\^{}2. Our results quantify the extent to which microscopic or mesoscopic reference frames may be used for repeated, high-precision measurements, without needing to be reset - a question that is important for some implementations of quantum computing.

The problem of correlating distant reference frames, of which aligning Cartesian axes and synchronizing clocks are important instances, is an example of a task that requires the exchange of unspeakable information and for which it is interesting to determine the fundamental quantum limit of efficiency. There have also been many investigations into the information theory that is appropriate for parties that lack reference frames or that lack correlation between their reference frames, restrictions that result in global and local superselection rules. In the presence of these, quantum unspeakable information becomes a new kind of resource that can be manipulated, depleted, quantified, etc. Methods have also been developed to contend with these restrictions using relational encodings, particularly in the context of computation, cryptography, communication, and the manipulation of entanglement.

Harnessing this power requires the development of a set of building blocks, one of which is a method to initialize the set of quantum bits (qubits) to a known state. Additionally, fresh ancillary qubits must be available during the course of computation to achieve fault tolerance. In any physical system used to implement quantum computation, one must therefore be able to selectively and dynamically remove entropy from the part of the system that is to be mapped to qubits. One such method is an 'open-system' cooling protocol in which a subset of qubits can be brought into contact with an external system of large heat capacity. Theoretical efforts have led to an implementation-independent cooling procedure, namely heat-bath algorithmic cooling. These efforts have culminated with the proposal of an optimal algorithm, the partner-pairing algorithm, which was used to compute the physical limits of heat-bath algorithmic cooling. Here we report the experimental realization of multi-step cooling of a quantum system via heat-bath algorithmic cooling. The experiment was carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance of a solid-state ensemble three-qubit system. We demonstrate the repeated repolarization of a particular qubit to an effective spin-bath temperature, and alternating logical operations within the three-qubit subspace to ultimately cool a second qubit below this temperature. Demonstration of the control necessary for these operations represents an important step forward in the manipulation of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance qubits.",

Most striking is the similarity in the behaviors of black-hole area and of entropy: Both quantities tend to increase irreversibly. In this paper we make this similarity the basis of a thermodynamic approach to black-hole physics. After a brief review of the elements of the theory of information, we discuss black-hole physics from the point of view of information theory. We show that it is natural to introduce the concept of black-hole entropy as the measure of information about a black-hole interior which is inaccessible to an exterior observer. Considerations of simplicity and consistency, and dimensional arguments indicate that the black-hole entropy is equal to the ratio of the black-hole area to the square of the Planck length times a dimensionless constant of order unity. A different approach making use of the specific properties of Kerr black holes and of concepts from information theory leads to the same conclusion, and suggests a definite value for the constant. The physical content of the concept of black-hole entropy derives from the following generalized version of the second law: When common entropy goes down a black hole, the common entropy in the black-hole exterior plus the black-hole entropy never decreases. The validity of this version of the second law is supported by an argument from information theory as well as by several examples.",

We suggested that the appropriate generalization of the second law for a region containing a black hole is that the black-hole entropy plus the common entropy in the black-hole exterior never decreases. Here we establish the validity of this law for the infall of an entropy-bearing system into a much larger and more massive generic stationary black hole. To do this we determine a general lower bound for the increase in black-hole entropy, and an upper bound for the entropy of the system, while allowing for quantum effects at each stage. In passing we show that the generalized second law is a statistical law which becomes over-whelmingly probable in the limit of a macroscopic system. We also consider briefly more general situations. Finally, we give two simple examples of predictions made by the generalized second law for black-hole formation processes.",

The bound states that the entropy S of any system with energy E and volume V cannot exceed the entropy of an equal volume and energy of unconfined thermal radiation. The bound is found to be violated by thermal field systems whose various dimensions differ by an order of magnitude or more, the violation occurring at intermediate energies. Unruh and Wald used the bound in an argument establishing the validity of the generalized second law when a box containing some entropy is lowered to near a black hole, then opened, and withdrawn open. If the box is thin in one direction, the failure of the bound for its contents makes it appear that a violation of the second law is possible. We show that, in fact, for a thin box the buoyancy effects on which Unruh and Wald's argument relies cancel out. As a result, the second law is fulfilled despite the failure of the bound. It appears from the second law that the bound must nevertheless hold when applied to box plus contents, but a direct proof of this is still lacking. We also consider the alternative entropy bound S≤2$\pi$ER/?c (2R is the largest dimension of the system) proposed earlier. For field systems it is shown to fail at very low energies, but to be valid for complete systems (i.e., box plus confined fields). Further, we show S≤2$\pi$ER/?c is a necessary condition for fulfillment of the second law when a thin system is dropped into a black hole (even in the face of buoyancy) in the sense that if the bound failed, the law would be violated.",

We consider a box full of entropy lowered toward and then dropped into a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in equilibrium with thermal radiation. We avoid the approximation that the buoyant pressure varies slowly across the box, and compute the buoyant force exactly. We find, in agreement with independent investigations, that the neutral point generically lies very near the horizon. A consequence is that in the generic case the Unruh-Wald entropy restriction is neither necessary nor sufficient for enforcement of the generalized second law. Another consequence is that generically the buoyancy makes only a negligible contribution to the energy bookkeeping, so that the original entropy bound is recovered if the generalized second law is assumed to hold. The number of particle species does not figure in the entropy bound, a point that has caused some perplexity. We demonstrate by explicit calculation that, for an arbitrarily large number of particle species, the bound is indeed satisfied by cavity thermal radiation in the thermodynamic regime, provided vacuum energies are included. We also show directly that thermal radiation in a cavity in D-dimensional space also respects the bound regardless of the value of D. As an application of the bound we show that it strongly restricts the information capacity of the posited black hole remnants, so that they cannot serve to resolve the information paradox.},

    abstract = "Entanglement purification protocols (EPPs) and quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) provide two ways of protecting quantum states from interaction with the environment. In an EPP, perfectly entangled pure states are extracted, with some yield D, from a mixed state M shared by two parties; with a QECC, an arbitrary quantum state |$\xi$〉 can be transmitted at some rate Q through a noisy channel $\chi$ without degradation. We prove that an EPP involving one-way classical communication and acting on mixed state M\^{}($\chi$) (obtained by sharing halves of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs through a channel $\chi$) yields a QECC on $\chi$ with rate Q=D, and vice versa. We compare the amount of entanglement E(M) required to prepare a mixed state M by local actions with the amounts D1(M) and D2(M) that can be locally distilled from it by EPPs using one- and two-way classical communication, respectively, and give an exact expression for E(M) when M is Bell diagonal. While EPPs require classical communication, QECCs do not, and we prove Q is not increased by adding one-way classical communication. However, both D and Q can be increased by adding two-way communication. We show that certain noisy quantum channels, for example a 50\% depolarizing channel, can be used for reliable transmission of quantum states if two-way communication is available, but cannot be used if only one-way communication is available. We exhibit a family of codes based on universal hashing able to achieve an asymptotic Q (or D) of 1-S for simple noise models, where S is the error entropy. We also obtain a specific, simple 5-bit single-error-correcting quantum block code. We prove that iff a QECC results in high fidelity for the case of no error then the QECC can be recast into a form where the encoder is the matrix inverse of the decoder. © 1996 The American Physical Society.",

The concentration process asymptotically conserves entropy of entanglement—the von Neumann entropy of the partial density matrix seen by either observer—with the yield of singlets approaching, for large n, the base-2 entropy of entanglement of the initial partly entangled pure state.

    abstract = {We show that quantum-to-classical channels, i.e., quantum measurements, can be asymptotically simulated by an amount of classical communication equal to the quantum mutual information of the measurement, if sufficient shared randomness is available. This result generalizes Winter's measurement compression theorem for fixed independent and identically distributed inputs [Winter, CMP 244 (157), 2004] to arbitrary inputs, and more importantly, it identifies the quantum mutual information of a measurement as the information gained by performing it, independent of the input state on which it is performed. Our result is a generalization of the classical reverse Shannon theorem to quantum-to-classical channels. In this sense, it can be seen as a quantum reverse Shannon theorem for quantum-to-classical channels, but with the entanglement assistance and quantum communication replaced by shared randomness and classical communication, respectively. The proof is based on a novel one-shot state merging protocol for "classically coherent states" as well as the post-selection technique for quantum channels, and it uses techniques developed for the quantum reverse Shannon theorem [Berta et al., CMP 306 (579), 2011].},

    abstract = "In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that the erasure of information is a dissipative process. A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science, the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.",

The demon's seductive quality makes it appealing to physical scientists, engineers, computer scientists, biologists, psychologists, and historians and philosophers of science.Since the publication of Maxwell's Demon: Entropy, Information, Computing in 1990, Maxwell's demon has been the subject of renewed and increased interest by numerous researchers in the fields mentioned above.

    abstract = "We prove that local random quantum circuits acting on n qubits composed of polynomially many nearest neighbor two-qubit gates form an approximate unitary poly(n)-design. Previously it was unknown whether random quantum circuits were a t-design for any t > 3. The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body theory, representation theory, and the theory of Markov chains. In particular we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of quantum local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks; and a result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups of the special unitary group, composed of elements with algebraic entries, are infinity-copy tensor-product expanders. We also consider pseudo-randomness properties of local random quantum circuits of small depth and prove they constitute a quantum poly(n)-copy tensor-product expander. The proof also rests on techniques from quantum many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of Aharonov et al. We give three applications of the results. First we show that almost every circuit U of size n\^{}k on n qubits cannot be distinguished from a Haar uniform unitary by circuits of size n\^{}[(k+3)/6] that are given oracle access to U; this provides a data-hiding scheme against computationally bounded adversaries. Second we reconsider a recent argument of Masanes et al concerning local equilibration of time-evolving quantum systems, and strengthen the connection between fast equilibration of small subsystems and the circuit complexity of the Hamiltonian. Third we show that in one dimension almost every parallel local circuit of linear depth generates topological order, matching an upper bound to the problem due to Bravyi et al.",

    abstract = "The ideas of thermodynamics have proved fruitful in the setting of quantum information theory, in particular the notion that when the allowed transformations of a system are restricted, certain states of the system become useful resources with which one can prepare previously inaccessible states. The theory of entanglement is perhaps the best-known and most well-understood resource theory in this sense. Here we return to the basic questions of thermodynamics using the formalism of resource theories developed in quantum information theory and show that the free energy of thermodynamics emerges naturally from the resource theory of energy-preserving transformations. Specifically, the free energy quantifies the amount of useful work which can be extracted from asymptotically-many copies of a quantum system when using only reversible energy-preserving transformations and a thermal bath at fixed temperature. The free energy also quantifies the rate at which resource states can be reversibly interconverted asymptotically, provided that a sublinear amount of coherent superposition over energy levels is available, a situation analogous to the sublinear amount of classical communication required for entanglement dilution.",

    abstract = {The second law of thermodynamics tells us which state transformations are so statistically unlikely that they are effectively forbidden. Its original formulation, due to Clausius, states that "Heat can never pass from a colder to a warmer body without some other change, connected therewith, occurring at the same time." The second law applies to systems composed of many particles, however, we are seeing that one can make sense of thermodynamics in the regime where we only have a small number of particles interacting with a heat bath, or when we have highly correlated systems and wish to make non-statistical statements about them. Is there a second law of thermodynamics in this regime? Here, we find that for processes which are cyclic or very close to cyclic, the second law for microscopic or highly correlated systems takes on a very different form than it does at the macroscopic scale, imposing not just one constraint on what state transformations are possible, but an entire family of constraints. In particular, we find that the Renyi relative entropy distances to the equilibrium state can never increase. We further find that there are three regimes which govern which family of second laws govern state transitions, depending on how cyclic the process is. In one regime one can cause an apparent violation of the usual second law, through a process of embezzling work from a large system which remains arbitrarily close to its original state.},

The bound of kTln2 is achieved in the unphysical infinite-time limit. Here we ask what is possible if one is restricted to finite-time protocols. We prove analytically that it is possible to reset a bit with a work cost close to kTln2 in a finite time. We construct an explicit protocol that achieves this, which involves changing the system's Hamiltonian avoiding quantum coherences, and thermalising. Using concepts and techniques pertaining to single-shot statistical mechanics, we further develop the limit on the work cost, proving that the heat dissipated is close to the minimal possible not just on average, but guaranteed with high confidence in every run. Moreover we exploit the protocol to design a quantum heat engine that works near the Carnot efficiency in finite time.",

The leading terms of the low frequency conductance are determined by a capacitive or inductive emittance and a dissipative charge relaxation resistance. The charge relaxation resistance is determined by the ratio of the mean square dwell time of the carriers in the conductor and the square of the mean dwell time. The contribution of each scattering channel is proportional to half a resistance quantum. We discuss the charge relaxation resistance for mesoscopic capacitors, quantum point contacts, chaotic cavities, ballistic wires and for transport along edge channels in the quantized Hall regime. At equilibrium the charge relaxation resistance also determines via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem the spontaneous fluctuations of charge on the conductor. Of particular interest are the charge fluctuations in the presence of transport in a regime where the conductor exhibits shot noise. At low frequencies and voltages charge relaxation is determined by a nonequilibrium charge relaxation resistance.",

We highlight that this method could be employed to obtain the work statistics of closed as well as open driven system, even in the strongly dissipative regime. We then illustrate an implementation of the method in a circuit QED setup, which allows one to experimentally obtain the work statistics of a parametrically driven harmonic oscillator.

To overcome this limitation, two different techniques, the information spectrum method and the smooth entropy framework, have been developed independently. They are based on new entropy measures, called spectral entropy rates and smooth entropies, respectively, that generalize Shannon entropy (in the classical case) and von Neumann entropy (in the more general quantum case). Here, we show that the two techniques are closely related. More precisely, the spectral entropy rate can be seen as the asymptotic limit of the smooth entropy. Our results apply to the quantum setting and thus include the classical setting as a special case.",

This gedanken experiment, based on the techniques of Aharonov and Susskind [Phys. Rev. 155, 1428 (1967)], explicitly violates the commonly-accepted superselection rule that forbids coherent superpositions of eigenstates of differing atom number. This interference experiment makes use of a Bose-Einstein condensate as a reference frame with which to perform the coherent operations analogous to Ramsey pulses. We also investigate an analogous gedanken experiment to exhibit a coherent superposition of a single boson and a fermion, violating the commonly-accepted superselection rule forbidding coherent superpositions of states of differing particle statistics; in this case, the reference frame is realized by a multi-mode state of many fermions. This latter case reproduces all of the relevant features of Ramsey interferometry, including Ramsey fringes over many repetitions of the experiment. However, the apparent inability of this proposed experiment to produce well-defined relative phases between two distinct systems each described by a coherent superposition of a boson and a fermion demonstrates that there are additional, outstanding requirements to fully ``lift'' the univalence superselection rule.",

Here, we study the conditions under which the correlation disappears completely, resulting in a decoupling of A from E. We give a criterion for decoupling in terms of two smooth entropies, one quantifying the amount of initial correlation between A and E, and the other characterizing the mapping that describes the evolution of A. The criterion applies to arbitrary such mappings and is tight if the mapping satisfies certain natural conditions. Decoupling has a number of applications both in physics and information theory, e.g., as a building block for quantum information processing protocols. As an example, we give a one-shot state merging protocol and show that it is essentially optimal in terms of its entanglement consumption/production.",

We will show that this problem can, in fact, be solved using decoupling ideas, specifically by proving a "dequantizing" theorem, which ensures that the environment is only classically correlated with the sent data. Our techniques naturally yield a generalization of the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland Theorem to the one-shot scenario, where a quantum channel can be applied only once.},

    abstract = "Standard thermodynamics is associated with the von Neumann entropy. There has recently been great interest in making thermodynamics more suitable for the quantum and nano-regime by taking inspiration from single-shot information theory, which replaces the von Neumann entropy with the more general smooth entropies. These reduce to the von Neumann entropy in the regime of asymptotically many identical and uncorrelated systems, the von Neumann regime. We propose generalisations of the laws of thermodynamics which analogously reduce to the standard laws in that same limit. We motivate these by analysing a very generic Szilard-engine model. We derive how much work one can extract in a single extraction as a function of the success-probability. Neither the initial nor final state is required to be thermal. In the appropriate limits we recover existing results.",

Here we prove a quantitative Landauer's principle for arbitrary processes, providing a general lower bound on their work cost. This bound is given by the minimum amount of (information theoretical) entropy that has to be dumped into the environment, as measured by the conditional max-entropy. The bound is tight up to a logarithmic term in the failure probability. Our result shows that the minimum amount of work required to carry out a given process depends on how much correlation we wish to retain between the input and the output systems, and that this dependence disappears only if we average the cost over many independent copies of the input state. Our proof is valid in a general framework that specifies the set of possible physical operations compatible with the second law of thermodynamics. We employ the technical toolbox of matrix majorization, which we extend and generalize to a new kind of majorization, called lambda-majorization. This allows us to formulate the problem as a semidefinite program and provide an optimal solution.",

    abstract = "The Toffoli gate is a three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) operation that inverts the state of a target qubit conditioned on the state of two control qubits. It makes universal reversible classical computation possible and, together with a Hadamard gate, forms a universal set of gates in quantum computation. It is also a key element in quantum error correction schemes. The Toffoli gate has been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance, linear optics and ion trap systems. Experiments with superconducting qubits have also shown significant progress recently: two-qubit algorithms and two-qubit process tomography have been implemented, three-qubit entangled states have been prepared, first steps towards quantum teleportation have been taken and work on quantum computing architectures has been done. Implementation of the Toffoli gate with only single- and two-qubit gates requires six controlled-NOT gates and ten single-qubit operations, and has not been realized in any system owing to current limits on coherence. Here we implement a Toffoli gate with three superconducting transmon qubits coupled to a microwave resonator. By exploiting the third energy level of the transmon qubits, we have significantly reduced the number of elementary gates needed for the implementation of the Toffoli gate, relative to that required in theoretical proposals using only two-level systems. Using full process tomography and Monte Carlo process certification, we completely characterize the Toffoli gate acting on three independent qubits, measuring a fidelity of 68.5 ± 0.5 per cent. A similar approach to realizing characteristic features of a Toffoli-class gate has been demonstrated with two qubits and a resonator and achieved a limited characterization considering only the phase fidelity. Our results reinforce the potential of macroscopic superconducting qubits for the implementation of complex quantum operations with the possibility of quantum error correction.",

We study this problem using entropy risk to quantify estimators' accuracy. We generalize the "add Beta" estimators that work well for noiseless coins, and we find that these hedged maximum-likelihood (HML) estimators achieve a worst-case risk of O(N\^{}\{-1/2\}) on noisy coins, in contrast to O(1/N) in the noiseless case. We demonstrate that this increased risk is unavoidable and intrinsic to noisy coins, by constructing minimax estimators (numerically). However, minimax estimators introduce extreme bias in return for slight improvements in the worst-case risk. So we introduce a pointwise lower bound on the minimum achievable risk as an alternative to the minimax criterion, and use this bound to show that HML estimators are pretty good. We conclude with a survey of scientific applications of the noisy coin model in social science, physical science, and quantum information science.},

    abstract = "Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. First, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e., the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Second, we show that unknown low-rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. We give a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds, for the realistic situation where the data contains noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper-bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed sensing estimators with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing estimators consistently produce higher-fidelity state reconstructions than MLE. In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster classical processing with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low rank estimate using direct fidelity estimation and we describe a method for compressed quantum process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank.",

Statistical tests are thus not sufficient to guarantee that an RNG is usable for applications, e.g., in cryptography or gambling, where unpredictability is important. To enable such applications a stronger notion of randomness, termed "true randomness", is required, which includes independence from prior information. Quantum systems are particularly suitable for true randomness generation, as their unpredictability can be proved based on physical principles. Practical implementations of Quantum RNGs (QRNGs) are however always subject to noise, i.e., influences which are not fully controlled. This reduces the quality of the raw randomness generated by the device, making it necessary to post-process it. Here we provide a framework to analyse realistic QRNGs and to determine the post-processing that is necessary to turn their raw output into true randomness.},

    abstract = {We review the first experiment on dynamic transport in a phase-coherent quantum conductor. In our discussion, we highlight the use of time-dependent transport as a means of gaining insight into charge relaxation on a mesoscopic scale. For this purpose, we studied the ac conductance of a model quantum conductor, i.e. the quantum RC circuit. Prior to our experimental work, B\"{u}ttiker et al (1993 Phys. Lett. A 180 364-9) first worked on dynamic mesoscopic transport in the 1990s. They predicted that the mesoscopic RC circuit can be described by a quantum capacitance related to the density of states in the capacitor and a constant charge-relaxation resistance equal to half of the resistance quantum h/2e(2), when a single mode is transmitted between the capacitance and a reservoir. By applying a microwave excitation to a gate located on top of a coherent submicronic quantum dot that is coupled to a reservoir, we validate this theoretical prediction on the ac conductance of the quantum RC circuit. Our study demonstrates that the ac conductance is directly related to the dwell time of electrons in the capacitor. Thereby, we observed a counterintuitive behavior of a quantum origin: as the transmission of the single conducting mode decreases, the resistance of the quantum RC circuit remains constant while the capacitance oscillates.},

It also illustrates that information theory is of some heuristic use in physics, by asking the right sort of questions. The chapter also discusses the two steps in the approach. The first step specifies the degrees of freedom of the phenomenon in such a way that one always operates with discrete degrees, and in all practical cases with a finite number of them. This, in MacKay's useful terminology, specifies the structural aspects of information. The second step is to specify the phenomenon by attaching a measure to each coordinate. In information theory, every phenomenon is described by a finite number of integers. There is no continuity, except in the probabilities.",

In this work, we establish a framework of work extraction in the presence of quantum correlations as they naturally emerge in quantum thermodynamics beyond the weak-coupling regime. Quantum correlations and entanglement, as they are ubiquitously encountered when putting systems into contact with a bath, emerge as a limitation to work extraction, rather than as an advantage. We bring together concepts of quantum thermodynamics with those of non-equilibrium dynamics, in a rigorous but physically motivated approach. We discuss various limits that relate to known results and put our work into context of approaches to finite-time quantum thermodynamics.",

    abstract = "We review recent work on the foundations of thermodynamics in the light of quantum information theory. We adopt a resource-theoretic perspective, wherein thermodynamics is formulated as a theory of what agents can achieve under a particular restriction, namely, that the only state preparations and transformations that they can implement for free are those that are thermal at some fixed temperature. States that are out of thermal equilibrium are the resources. We consider the special case of this theory wherein all systems have trivial Hamiltonians (that is, all of their energy levels are degenerate). In this case, the only free operations are those that add noise to the system (or implement a reversible evolution) and the only nonequilibrium states are states of informational nonequilibrium, that is, states that deviate from the maximally mixed state. The degree of this deviation we call the state's nonuniformity; it is the resource of interest here, the fuel that is consumed, for instance, in an erasure operation. We consider the different types of state conversion: exact and approximate, single-shot and asymptotic, catalytic and noncatalytic. In each case, we present the necessary and sufficient conditions for the conversion to be possible for any pair of states, emphasizing a geometrical representation of the conditions in terms of Lorenz curves. We also review the problem of quantifying the nonuniformity of a state, in particular through the use of generalized entropies. Quantum state conversion problems in this resource theory can be shown to be always reducible to their classical counterparts, so that there are no inherently quantum-mechanical features arising in such problems. This body of work also demonstrates that the standard formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is inadequate as a criterion for deciding whether or not a given state transition is possible.",

While the exact incompatibility of quantum measurements dictated by such uncertainty relations can be inferred from the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, the question remains whether there is any more fundamental reason for the uncertainty relations to have this exact form. What, if any, would be the operational consequences if we were able to go beyond any of these uncertainty relations? Here we give a strong argument that justifies uncertainty relations in quantum theory by showing that violating them implies that it is also possible to violate the second law of thermodynamics. More precisely, we show that violating the uncertainty relations in quantum mechanics leads to a thermodynamic cycle with positive net work gain, which is very unlikely to exist in nature.",

Here, a protocol is demonstrated allowing one to make these transformations reversible. The pure states are diluted with a random noise source. Using this protocol one can study optimal transformations between states, and from this derive the unique measure of information. This is compared to irreversible transformations where one does not have access to noise. The ideas presented here shed some light on attempts to understand entanglement manipulations and the inevitable irreversibility encountered there where one finds that mixed states can contain "bound entanglement".},

In the classical case, if the receiver has some prior information about the messages being conveyed, less communication is needed. Here we explore the concept of prior quantum information: given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems, we determine how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system. This communication measures the partial information one system needs, conditioned on its prior information. We find that it is given by the conditional entropy--a quantity that was known previously, but lacked an operational meaning. In the classical case, partial information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it is negative, then sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential for future quantum communication. We introduce a protocol that we term 'quantum state merging' which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several important applications including distributed compression, noiseless coding with side information, multiple access channels and assisted entanglement distillation.",

This divides the state space into various sets, including states which are free (because they can be created under the class of operations), and those which are a resource (because they cannot be). One can quantify the worth of the resource by the relative entropy distance to the set of free states, and under certain conditions, this is a unique measure which quantifies the rate of state to state transitions. The framework includes entanglement, asymmetry and purity theory. It also includes thermodynamics, which is a hybrid resource theory combining purity theory and asymmetry. Another hybrid resource theory which merges purity theory and entanglement can be used to study quantumness of correlations and discord, and we present quantumness in this more general framework of resource theories.",

Here we study thermodynamics in the opposite regime -- at both the nano scale, and when quantum effects become important. Applying results from quantum information theory we construct a theory of thermodynamics in these extreme limits. In the quantum regime, we find that the standard free energy no longer determines the amount of work which can be extracted from a resource, nor which state transitions can occur spontaneously. We derive a criteria for thermodynamical state transitions, and find two free energies: one which determines the amount of work which can be extracted from a small system in contact with a heat bath, and the other which quantifies the reverse process. They imply that generically, there are additional constraints which govern spontaneous thermodynamical processes. We find that there are fundamental limitations on work extraction from nonequilibrium states, due to both finite size effects which are present at the nano scale, as well as quantum coherences. This implies that thermodynamical transitions are generically irreversible at this scale, and we quantify the degree to which this is so, and the condition for reversibility to hold. There are particular equilibrium processes which approach the ideal efficiency, provided that certain special conditions are met.",

One central aspect in obtaining such bounds is to determine how long a system retains memory of its initial conditions. By viewing this problem from an quantum information theory perspective, we are able to simplify part of this task in a very natural and easy way. We first show that for any interaction between the system and the environment, and almost all initial states of the system, the question of how long such memory lasts can be answered by studying the temporal evolution of just one special initial state. This special state thereby depends only on our knowledge of macroscopic parameters of the system. We provide a simple entropic inequality for this state that can be used to determine whether mosts states of the system have, or have not become independent of their initial conditions after time t. Analyzing the rate of entropy change over time for a particular kind of interaction then allows us to place rigorous bounds on such time scales. We make a similar statement for almost all initial states of the environment, and finally provide a sufficient condition for which a system never thermalizes, but remains close to its initial state for all times.",

We argue that the reliability of the bit erasure process is bounded by the accuracy inherent in the statistical state of the energy source (`the resources') driving the process. We develop a general framework describing the `thermodynamic worth' of the resources with respect to reliable bit erasure or good cooling. This worth turns out to be given by the distinguishability of the resource's state from its equilibrium state in the sense of a statistical inference problem. Accordingly, Kullback-Leibler relative information is a decisive quantity for the `worth' of the resource's state. Due to the asymmetry of relative information, the reliability of the erasure process is bounded rather by the relative information of the equilibrium state wit respect to the actual state than by the relative information of the actual state with respect to the equilibrium state (which is the free energy up to constants).",

    abstract = {Information theory provides a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge, and leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum-entropy estimate. It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.It is concluded that statistical mechanics need not be regarded as a physical theory dependent for its validity on the truth of additional assumptions not contained in the laws of mechanics (such as ergodicity, metric transitivity, equal a priori probabilities, etc.). Furthermore, it is possible to maintain a sharp distinction between its physical and statistical aspects. The former consists only of the correct enumeration of the states of a system and their properties; the latter is a straightforward example of statistical inference.},

    abstract = {Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of radiation.It is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because $\rho$?(t) does not depend only on $\rho$(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type $\rho$(t)=G(t, 0)$\rho$(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0→t). Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities. However, such equations often represent useful approximations.},

In the special case where A is classical, this overlap corresponds to the probability of guessing A given B. In a similar vein, we connect the conditional max-entropy Hmax(A|B) to the maximum fidelity of rho\_AB with a product state that is completely mixed on A. In the case where A is classical, this corresponds to the security of A when used as a secret key in the presence of an adversary holding B. Because min- and max-entropies are known to characterize information-processing tasks such as randomness extraction and state merging, our results establish a direct connection between these tasks and basic operational problems. For example, they imply that the (logarithm of the) probability of guessing A given B is a lower bound on the number of uniform secret bits that can be extracted from A relative to an adversary holding B.",

    abstract = "There has recently been a good deal of controversy about Landauer's Principle, which is often stated as follows: the erasure of one bit of information in a computational device is necessarily accompanied by a generation of kTln2 heat. This is often generalised to the claim that any logically irreversible operation cannot be implemented in a thermodynamically reversible way. Norton [2005. Eaters of the lotus: Landauer's principle and the return of Maxwell's demon. Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 36, 375–411] and Maroney [2005. The (absence of a) relationship between thermodynamic and logical reversibility. Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 36, 355–374] both argue that Landauer's Principle has not been shown to hold in general, and Maroney offers a method that he claims instantiates the operation Reset in a thermodynamically reversible way. In this paper we defend the qualitative form of Landauer's Principle, and clarify its quantitative consequences (assuming the second law of thermodynamics). We analyse in detail what it means for a physical system to implement a logical transformation L, and we make this precise by defining the notion of an L-machine. Then we show that logical irreversibility of L implies thermodynamic irreversibility of every corresponding L-machine. We do this in two ways. First, by assuming the phenomenological validity of the Kelvin statement of the second law, and second, by using information-theoretic reasoning. We illustrate our results with the example of the logical transformation ‘Reset’, and thereby recover the quantitative form of Landauer's Principle.",

This was done with the aid of a hypothetical device involving the use of a particle held in a time‐modulated potential well, and coupled through springs to other such particles. The previous analysis was limited to the case of wells modulated very slowly compared to the relaxation time for particle redistribution. The present analysis extends these studies to the case of computations proceeding at arbitrary velocity. The same hypothetical device is invoked, with minor modifications for analytical tractability. Energy dissipation is found to be minimal for potential wells endowed with critical damping and the dissipation is roughly proportional to computing rate. The error rate also increases with computing velocity and is lowered by critical damping, but is less sensitive to these parameters, and is largely dependent on the magnitude of the interaction potentials between wells.",

One of the main concepts that makes everything work is the comparison principle (which, in essence, states that given any two states of the same chemical composition at least one is adiabatically accessible from the other) and we show that it can be derived from some assumptions about the pressure and thermal equilibrium. Temperature is derived from entropy, but at the start not even the concept of ‘hotness’ is assumed.

    abstract = "In earlier work, we presented a foundation for the second law of classical thermodynamics in terms of the entropy principle. More precisely, we provided an empirically accessible axiomatic derivation of an entropy function defined on all equilibrium states of all systems that has the appropriate additivity and scaling properties, and whose increase is a necessary and sufficient condition for an adiabatic process between two states to be possible. Here, after a brief review of this approach, we address the question of defining entropy for non-equilibrium states. Our conclusion is that it is generally not possible to find a unique entropy that has all relevant physical properties. We do show, however, that one can define two entropy functions, called S - and S +, which, taken together, delimit the range of adiabatic processes that can occur between non-equilibrium states. The concept of comparability of states with respect to adiabatic changes plays an important role in our reasoning.",

This has applications in quantum state tomography, and is a non-commutative analogue of a well-known problem in compressed sensing: recovering a sparse vector from a few of its Fourier coefficients. We show that almost all sets of O(rd log\^{}6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rank-r restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a fixed ("universal") set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley's inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers obtained via entropy duality.},

Free energy relations constrain the former, but the latter requires a new, independent set of second laws that govern the coherent component of thermodynamic transformations. To this end we establish thermodynamic constraints that are valid in arbitrarily non-classical regimes, and applicable to non-equilibrium systems and arbitrary system-bath couplings strength. Their classical limit and some of their consequences are explored. In particular we show that energy eigenbasis coherence does not contribute to extractable work, although it can be made partially accessible as relational coherence in a multipartite scenario. The coherence conditions we introduce here are independent of free energy relations, and provide non-trivial additional constraints on the thermodynamics of quantum systems.",

Ideas such as Landauer's erasure principle and information assisted work extraction have greatly contributed not only to enlarge our understanding about the fundamental limits imposed by nature, but also to enlighten the path for practical implementations of information processing devices. The intricate information-thermodynamics relation also entails a fundamental limit on parameter estimation, establishing a thermodynamic cost for information acquisition. More specifically, we show that the amount of information that can be encoded in a physical system (and consequently extracted) by means of any process is limited by the dissipated work during the implementation of the process. This includes a thermodynamic trade-off for information acquisition. Likewise, any information acquisition process is ultimately limited by the second law of thermodynamics. Such a trade-off may find applications in several areas of knowledge, since parameter estimation lies in the building basis of all natural sciences and several technological applications, such as metrology.",

These two fundamental features have thus far been distinct concepts. We show that they are inextricably and quantitatively linked: Quantum mechanics cannot be more nonlocal with measurements that respect the uncertainty principle. In fact, the link between uncertainty and nonlocality holds for all physical theories. More specifically, the degree of nonlocality of any theory is determined by two factors: the strength of the uncertainty principle and the strength of a property called "steering," which determines which states can be prepared at one location given a measurement at another.},

First, by using a bipartite memory we show that the work extractable from a heat engine is bounded not only by the free energy change and the sum of the entropy change of an individual memory but also by the change of quantum mutual information contained inside the memory. We then find that the engine can be driven by purely quantum information, expressed as the so-called quantum discord, forming a part of the quantum mutual information. To confirm it, as a physical example we present the Szilard engine containing a diatomic molecule with a semi-permeable wall.",

We investigate the conditional min- and max-entropy for quantum states, generalizations of classical R\'{e}nyi entropies. We introduce the purified distance, a novel metric for unnormalized quantum states and use it to define smooth entropies as optimizations of the min- and max-entropies over a ball of close states. We explore various properties of these entropies, including data-processing inequalities, chain rules and their classical limits. The most important property is an entropic formulation of the asymptotic equipartition property, which implies that the smooth entropies converge to the von Neumann entropy in the limit of many independent copies. The smooth entropies also satisfy duality and entropic uncertainty relations that provide limits on the power of two different observers to predict the outcome of a measurement on a quantum system. Finally, we discuss three example applications of the smooth entropy framework. We show a strong converse statement for source coding with quantum side information, characterize randomness extraction against quantum side information and prove information theoretic security of quantum key distribution using an intuitive argument based on the entropic uncertainty relation.",

Here we suggest that the main postulate of statistical mechanics, the equal a priori probability postulate, should be abandoned as misleading and unnecessary. We argue that it should be replaced by a general canonical principle, whose physical content is fundamentally different from the postulate it replaces: it refers to individual states, rather than to ensemble or time averages. Furthermore, whereas the original postulate is an unprovable assumption, the principle we propose is mathematically proven. The key element in this proof is the quantum entanglement between the system and its environment. Our approach separates the issue of finding the canonical state from finding out how close a system is to it, allowing us to go even beyond the usual boltzmannian situation.",

Crucial parameters in our model are the distances between the acids and the coupling between them, which we estimate from numerical simulations [1]. We show that for realistic parameters nearest neighbour entanglement is present even at room temperature. We quantify the amount of entanglement in terms of negativity and single base von Neumann entropy. We find that the strength of the single base von Neumann entropy depends on the neighbouring sites, thus questioning the notion of treating single bases as logically independent units. We derive an analytical expression for the binding energy of the coupled chain in terms of entanglement and show the connection between entanglement and correlation energy, a quantity commonly used in quantum chemistry.",

    abstract = "Reliable and well-characterized quantum resources are indispensable ingredients in quantum information processing. Typically, in a realistic characterization of these resources, apparatuses come with intrinsic uncertainties that can manifest themselves in the form of systematic errors. While systematic errors are generally accounted for through careful calibration, the effect of remaining imperfections on the characterization of quantum resources has been largely overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the effect of systematic errors that arise from imperfect alignment of measurement bases—an error that can conceivably take place due to the limited controllability of measurement devices. We show that characterization of quantum resources using quantum state tomography or entanglement witnesses can be undermined with an amount of such imprecision that is not uncommon in laboratories. Curiously, for quantum state tomography, we find that having entanglement can help to reduce the susceptibility to this kind of error. We also briefly discuss how a given entanglement witness can be modified to incorporate the effect of such errors.",

Here we demonstrate such behaviour experimentally. We have studied the behaviour of colloidal particles suspended in solution and exposed to a sawtooth dielectric potential which is turned on and off periodically. The particles exhibit net motion with a velocity that depends on their size, suggesting applications in separation processes for objects in the size range 0.1-5 microns--a range that includes biological structures such as viruses, cells and chromosomes.

Our method is advantageous over the full determination of the density matrix in that it is insensitive to experimental fluctuations in j, and allows for a natural elimination of high-frequency noise in the Wigner function by taking into account the experimental uncertainties in the determination of j, its projection m, and the quantization axis orientation. No data binning and no arbitrary smoothing parameters are necessary in this reconstruction. Using recently published data [Riedel et al., Nature 464:1170 (2010)] we reconstruct the Wigner function of a spin-squeezed state of a Bose-Einstein condensate of about 1250 atoms, demonstrating that measurements along quantization axes lying in a single plane are sufficient for performing this tomographic reconstruction.

To be statistically meaningful, they have to be endowed with error regions, the generalization of error bars beyond one dimension. As opposed to standard ad hoc constructions of error regions, we introduce the maximum-likelihood region—the region of largest likelihood among all regions of the same size—as the natural counterpart of the popular maximum-likelihood estimator. Here, the size of a region is its prior probability. A related concept is the smallest credible region—the smallest region with pre-chosen posterior probability. In both cases, the optimal error region has constant likelihood on its boundary. This surprisingly simple characterization permits concise reporting of the error regions, even in high-dimensional problems. For illustration, we identify optimal error regions for single-qubit and two-qubit states from computer-generated data that simulate incomplete tomography with few measured copies.",

Our proof is based on the fact that the analogue of the second law of thermodynamics dQ≤kBTdS holds rigorously by virtue of the Fokker-Planck equation, even if the potential is not static.

Taking as our work storage system a 'weight' we prove the second law and then present simple protocols which extract average work equal to the free energy change of the system - the same amount as in classical thermodynamics. Crucially, for systems in 'classical' states (mixtures of energy eigenstates) our protocol works on a single copy of the system. This is in sharp contrast to previous results, which showed that in case of almost-deterministic work extraction, collective actions on multiple copies are necessary to extract the free energy. This establishes the fact that free energy is a meaningful notion even for individual systems in classical states. However, for non-classical states, where coherences between energy levels exist, we prove that collective actions are necessary, so long as no external sources of coherence are used.",

However, when the description of the experiment needs to be connected to textbook quantum mechanics, explicit expressions for the states and the POVM elements in terms of positive semidefinite matrices are required.

Experiments (e.g., involving superconducting qubits) have shown that we do not always have a good understanding of how to model the measurements with positive operator valued measures (POVMs). It turns out that the ad hoc postulation of POVMs can lead to inconsistencies. For example when doing asymptotic state tomography via linear inversion, one sometime ends up with density matrices that are not positive semidefinite. We propose an alternative procedure where we do not make any a priori assumptions on the quantum model, i.e., on the Hilbert space dimension, the states or the POVMs. In this paper, we take the first steps along this program by estimating the Gram matrix associated with the states and the measurements. The Gram matrix specifies the Hilbert space dimension and determines all the states and the POVM elements, up to simultaneous rotations in the space of Hermitian matrices. We are guided by Occam's razor, i.e., we search for the minimal quantum model consistent with the data. In an upcoming paper we will show how the explicit valid density matrices and POVM elements can be found, using a heuristic algorithm that takes the state-measurement Gram matrix as input.",

In this paper, we first provide a sufficient criterion to test, which additional assumptions (such as the projectiveness of some measurements) suffice to guarantee the uniqueness of the state-measurement Gram matrix up to discrete symmetries. Subsequently, inspired by the non-uniqueness of the Gram matrix in situations involving full-rank matrices, we examine more closely scenarios involving projective, non-degenerate measurements and their pure post-measurement states.

The technical analysis is illustrated in the simplified context of (1+1)-dimensional dilaton gravity. Our postulates imply that the dissipative properties of the stretched horizon arise from a course graining of microphysical degrees of freedom that the horizon must possess. A principle of black-hole complementarity is advocated. The overall viewpiont is similar to that poineered by 't Hooft but the detailed implementation is different.},

The AMPS argument relies on an implicit assumption---the ``proximity postulate---which says that the interior of a black hole must be constructed from degrees of freedom that are physically near the black hole. The proximity postulate manifestly contradicts the idea that interior information is redundant with information in Hawking radiation, which is very far from the black hole. AMPS argue that a violation of the proximity postulate would lead to a contradiction in a thought-experiment in which Alice distills the Hawking radiation and brings a bit back to the black hole. According to AMPS the only way to protect against the contradiction is for a firewall to form at the Page time. But the measurement that Alice must make, is of such a fine-grained nature that carrying it out before the black hole evaporates may be impossible. Harlow and Hayden have found evidence that the limits of quantum computation do in fact prevent Alice from carrying out her experiment in less than exponential time. If their conjecture is correct then black hole complementarity may be alive and well. My aim here is to give an overview of the firewall argument, and its basis in the proximity postulate; as well as the counterargument based on computational complexity, as conjectured by Harlow and Hayden.",

Subsequently, we consider arrowing—a way of building a new function out of a given one. The procedure originates from constructions of intrinsic information and entanglement of formation. We show that arrowing preserves asymptotic continuity for a class of functions (so-called subextensive ones). The result is illustrated by means of several examples.",

One may ask under which conditions this evolution destroys all initial correlations between the subsystems A and R, i.e. decouples the subsystems. A quantitative answer to this question is provided by decoupling theorems, which have been developed recently in the area of quantum information theory. This paper builds on preceding work, which shows that decoupling is achieved if the evolution on A consists of a typical unitary, chosen with respect to the Haar measure, followed by a process that adds sufficient decoherence. Here, we prove a generalized decoupling theorem for the case where the unitary is chosen from an approximate two-design. A main implication of this result is that decoupling is physical, in the sense that it occurs already for short sequences of random two-body interactions, which can be modeled as efficient circuits. Our decoupling result is independent of the dimension of the R system, which shows that approximate two-designs are appropriate for decoupling even if the dimension of this system is large.",

A two-dimensional model is investigated where it is shown that using fermion-boson cancellation on the stress-energy tensor reduces the energy outflow to zero, while other noncovariant techniques give the Hawking result. A technique for replacing the collapse by boundary conditions on the past horizon is developed which retains the essential features of the collapse while eliminating some of the difficulties. This set of boundary conditions is also suggested as the most natural set for a preexistent black hole. The behavior of particle detectors under acceleration is investigated where it is shown that an accelerated detector even in flat spacetime will detect particles in the vacuum. The similarity of this case with the behavior of a detector near the black hole is brought out, and it is shown that a geodesic detector near the horizon will not see the Hawking flux of particles. Finally, the work of Berger, Chitre, Nutku, and Moncrief on scalar geons is corrected, and the spherically symmetric coupled scalar-gravitation Hamiltonian is presented in the hope that someone can apply it to the problem of black-hole evaporation.",

    abstract = {We consider a general, classical theory of gravity in n dimensions, arising from a diffeomorphism-invariant Lagrangian. In any such theory, to each vector field $\xi$a on spacetime one can associate a local symmetry and, hence, a Noether current (n-1)-form j and (for solutions to the field equations) a Noether charge (n-2)-form Q, both of which are locally constructed from $\xi$a and the fields appearing in the Lagrangian. Assuming only that the theory admits stationary black hole solutions with a bifurcate Killing horizon (with bifurcation surface $\Sigma$), and that the canonical mass and angular momentum of solutions are well defined at infinity, we show that the first law of black hole mechanics always holds for perturbations to nearby stationary black hole solutions. The quantity playing the role of black hole entropy in this formula is simply 2$\pi$ times the integral over $\Sigma$ of the Noether charge (n-2)-form associated with the horizon Killing field. Furthermore, we show that this black hole entropy always is given by a local geometrical expression on the horizon of the black hole. We thereby obtain a natural candidate for the entropy of a dynamical black hole in a general theory of gravity. Our results show that the validity of the "second law" of black hole mechanics in dynamical evolution from an initially stationary black hole to a final stationary state is equivalent to the positivity of a total Noether flux, and thus may be intimately related to the positive energy properties of the theory. The relationship between the derivation of our formula for black hole entropy and the derivation via "Euclidean methods" also is explained.},

In this work, we prove lower bounds on the size of confidence regions reported by any region estimator for a given ensemble of probe states and probability of success. Our bounds are derived from a previously unnoticed connection between the size of confidence regions and the error probabilities of a corresponding binary hypothesis test. In group-covariant scenarios, we find that there is an ultimate bound for any estimation scheme which depends only on the representation-theoretic data of the probe system, and we evaluate its asymptotics in the limit of many systems, establishing a general "Heisenberg limit" for region estimation. We apply our results to several examples, in particular to phase estimation, where our bounds allow us to recover the well-known Heisenberg and shot-noise scaling.},

With this definition of a physical state, even in entangled states nothing that is done in one isolated system can instantaneously effect the physical state of a distant isolated system. This change in the description of physical states opens up a large variety of new ways that the density matrix may transform under various symmetries, different from the unitary transformations of ordinary quantum mechanics. Such new transformation properties have been explored before, but so far only for the symmetry of time translations into the future, treated as a semi-group. Here new transformation properties are studied for general symmetry transformations forming groups, rather than semi-groups. Arguments are given that such symmetries should act on the density matrix as in ordinary quantum mechanics, but loopholes are found for all of these arguments.",

    abstract = "Winter’s measurement compression theorem stands as one of the most penetrating insights of quantum information theory. In addition to making an original and profound statement about measurement in quantum theory, it also underlies several other general protocols used for entanglement distillation and local purity distillation. The theorem provides for an asymptotic decomposition of any quantum measurement into noise and information . This decomposition leads to an optimal protocol for having a sender simulate many independent instances of a quantum measurement and send the measurement outcomes to a receiver, using as little communication as possible. The protocol assumes that the parties have access to some amount of common randomness, which is a strictly weaker resource than classical communication. In this review, we provide a second look at Winter’s measurement compression theorem, detailing the information processing task, giving examples for understanding it, reviewing Winter’s achievability proof, and detailing a new approach to its single-letter converse theorem. We prove an extension of the theorem to the case in which the sender is not required to receive the outcomes of the simulated measurement. The total cost of common randomness and classical communication can be lower for such a ‘non-feedback’ simulation, and we prove a single-letter converse theorem demonstrating optimality. We then review the Devetak–Winter theorem on classical data compression with quantum side information, providing new proofs of its achievability and converse parts. From there, we outline a new protocol that we call ‘measurement compression with quantum side information,’ announced previously by two of us in our work on triple trade-offs in quantum Shannon theory. This protocol has several applications, including its part in the ‘classically-assisted state redistribution’ protocol, which is the most general protocol on the static side of the quantum information theory tree, and its role in reducing the classical communication cost in a task known as local purity distillation. We also outline a connection between measurement compression with quantum side information and recent work on entropic uncertainty relations in the presence of quantum memory. Finally, we prove a single-letter theorem characterizing measurement compression with quantum side information when the sender is not required to obtain the measurement outcome.",

We are able to give an asymptotically tight separation of this form, with the "intrinsic" data quantfied by the Holevo mutual information of a certain state ensemble associated to the POVM and the source, in a model that can be viewed as the asymptotic version of the convex decomposition of POVMs into extremal ones. This result is applied to a similar separation therorem for quantum instruments and quantum operations, in their Kraus form. Finally we comment on links to related subjects: we stress the difference between data and information (in particular by pointing out that information typically is strictly less than data), derive the Holevo bound from our main result, and look at its classical case: we show that this includes the solution to the problem of extrinsic/intrinsic data separation with a known source, then compare with the well-known notion of sufficient statistics. The result on decomposition of quantum operations is used to exhibit a new aspect of the concept of entropy exchange of an open dynamics. An appendix collects several estimates for mixed state fidelity and trace norm distance, that seem to be new, in particular a construction of canonical purification of mixed states that turns out to be valuable to analyze their fidelity.},

Here we report the experimental demonstration of topological error correction with an eight-photon cluster state. We show that a correlation can be protected against a single error on any quantum bit. Also, when all quantum bits are simultaneously subjected to errors with equal probability, the effective error rate can be significantly reduced.

    abstract = "The heat generated by computations is not only an obstacle to circuit miniaturization but also a fundamental aspect of the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics. In principle, reversible operations may be performed at no energy cost; given that irreversible computations can always be decomposed into reversible operations followed by the erasure of data, the problem of calculating their energy cost is reduced to the study of erasure. Landauer's principle states that the erasure of data stored in a system has an inherent work cost and therefore dissipates heat. However, this consideration assumes that the information about the system to be erased is classical, and does not extend to the general case where an observer may have quantum information about the system to be erased, for instance by means of a quantum memory entangled with the system. Here we show that the standard formulation and implications of Landauer's principle are no longer valid in the presence of quantum information. Our main result is that the work cost of erasure is determined by the entropy of the system, conditioned on the quantum information an observer has about it. In other words, the more an observer knows about the system, the less it costs to erase it. This result gives a direct thermodynamic significance to conditional entropies, originally introduced in information theory. Furthermore, it provides new bounds on the heat generation of computations: because conditional entropies can become negative in the quantum case, an observer who is strongly correlated with a system may gain work while erasing it, thereby cooling the environment.",

We here present a measure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement, this quantity is straightforward to calculate, and we find it to be precisely equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al. It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum reference frame.
