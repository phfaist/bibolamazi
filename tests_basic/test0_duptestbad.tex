% For testing purposes, I have edited this file manually and modified the header. Now,

% You should include this file in your main LaTeX file with the command

%   \input{dupfile.tex}
%
% in your document preamble.

%
% The following will define the command \bibalias{<alias>}{<source>}, which will make
% the command \cite[..]{<alias>} the same as doing \cite[..]{<source>}.

% This code has been copied and adapted from

\makeatletter
% \bibalias{<alias>}{<source>} makes \cite{<alias>} equivalent to \cite{<source>}
\newcommand\bibalias[2]{%

}


%
% Note: The `\cite` command provided here does not accept spaces in/between its
% arguments. This might be tricky, since revTeX does accept those spaces. You
% can work around by using LaTeX comments which automatically remove the
% following space after newline, in the following way:
%
%    \cite{key1,%
%          key2,%
%          key3%
%    }
%
% Make sure you don't add space between the comma and the percent sign.
