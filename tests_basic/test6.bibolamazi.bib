% %%     https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi
% %%
% %% See comments below this configuration section if you're new to bibolamazi.
%
% %% This is the BIBOLAMAZI configuration section. Additional two leading
% %% percent signs indicate comments within the configuration.
%
% %% **** SOURCES ****
%
% %% The _first_ accessible file in _each_ source list will be read
%
% src: srcbib/specialtests.bib
%
% %% Add additional sources here. Alternative files are useful, e.g., if the
% %% same file is to be accessed with different paths on different machines.
%
% %% **** FILTERS ****
%
% %% Specify filters here. Specify as many filters as you want, each with a
% %% `filter:' directive. See also `bibolamazi --list-filters' and
