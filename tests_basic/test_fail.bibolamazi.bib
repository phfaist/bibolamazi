% %% This bibliography database uses BIBOLAMAZI:
% %%
% %%     https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi
% %%
%
% %% This is the BIBOLAMAZI configuration section. Additional two leading
% %% percent signs indicate comments within the configuration.
%
% %% **** SOURCES ****
%
% %% The _first_ accessible file in _each_ source list will be read
%
% src: srcbib/fail01.bib
%
% %% pybtex fails for this one, and generates a syntax error
% src: srcbib/fail02.bib
%
% src: srcbib/fail03.bib
%
% %% Add additional sources here. Alternative files are useful, e.g., if the
% %% same file is to be accessed with different paths on different machines.
%
% %% **** FILTERS ****
%
% %% Specify filters here. Specify as many filters as you want, each with a
% %% `filter:' directive. See also `bibolamazi --list-filters' and
% %% `bibolamazi --help <filter>', or the "Help & Reference" page of the
% %% graphical interface.
%
% filter: arxiv -sMode=strip -sUnpublishedMode=eprint
%
% %% Finally, if your file is in a VCS, sort all entries by citation key so that
% %% you don't get huge file differences for each commit each time bibolamazi is
% %% run:
% filter: orderentries
%
%%%-BIB-OLA-MAZI-END-%%%
%
%
% ALL CHANGES BEYOND THIS POINT WILL BE LOST NEXT TIME BIBOLAMAZI IS RUN.

% the given options. Your sources will not be altered.
%
% Any entries ABOVE the configuration section will be preserved as is, which means that
% if you don't want to install bibolamazi or if it not installed, and you want to add
% a bibliographic entry to this file, add it AT THE TOP OF THIS FILE.
