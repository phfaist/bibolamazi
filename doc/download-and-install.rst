Downloading and Installing Bibolamazi
-------------------------------------

Bibolamazi comes in two flavors:

- an Application that runs on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows (this is what most
  users probably want)

- a command-line tool (for more advanced and automated usage)

There are precompiled ready-for-use binaries for the Application (see below,
:ref:`bibolamazi_application`). Alternatively, both flavors may be installed
using ``pip``/``setuptools`` or from source (see
:ref:`bibolamazi_installing_cmdl`).

.. _bibolamazi_application:

The Bibolamazi Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're unsure which flavor to get, this is the one you're looking for. It's
straightfoward to download, there is no installation required, and the
application is easy to use.

Download the latest release from our releases page:

**Download Release:** https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi/releases

These binaries don't need any installation, you can just download them, place
them wherever you want, and run them.

You may now start using Bibolamazi normally. To read more on bibolamazi, skip to
:ref:`using-bibolamazi-app`.


.. _bibolamazi_installing_cmdl:

Installing the Command-Line Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bibolamazi runs with Python 3 (this is there by default on most linux and Mac
systems).

Additionally, the graphical user interface requires PyQt5_. You can do this
usually with ``pip install pyqt5``. If you're on a linux distribution, it's most
probably in your distribution packages. Note you only need PyQt5 to run the
graphical user interface: the command-line version will happily run without.

**The easy way: via PIP**

The recommended way to install Bibolamazi command line and gui interfaces is via
``pip``::

  pip install bibolamazi        # for the command-line interface
  pip install bibolamazigui     # if you want the GUI interface

After that, you'll find the ``bibolamazi`` (respectively ``bibolamazi_gui``)
executables in your PATH::

  > bibolamazi --help           # command-line interface
  (...)
  > bibolamazi_gui              # to launch the GUI
  (...)
  

**The less easy way: From Source**

You may, alternatively, download and compile the packages from source.

- First, clone this repository on your computer::

    > cd somewhere/where/I/want/to/keep/bibolamazi/
    ...> git clone https://github.com/phfaist/bibolamazi

- Then, run the setup script to install the package and script (see `Installing
  Python Modules <https://docs.python.org/3/install/>`_)::

    > python setup.py install

  After that, you should find the ``bibolamazi`` executable in your PATH
  automatically::

    > bibolamazi --help

- If you want to install the GUI Application, you need to do that seperately. Go
  into the ``gui/`` directory of the source code, and run the python setup
  script there::

    > cd gui/
    gui> python setup.py install

  After that, you should find the ``bibolamazi_gui`` executable in your PATH
  automatically::

    > bibolamazi_gui
