Applies patches marked in the bibliography database as special entries named "xxx.PATCH"
"""

HELP_TEXT = r"""

Suppose that you keep your bibtex database synchronized with a bibliography
manager.  Suppose that for a single document, you need to tweak some specific
bibtex entries (e.g., maybe you need add annot={...} fields with some specific
annotations which you otherwise wouldn't want to have).  You can do that by
creating a bibtex file with entries of the form "xyz.PATCH".  This filter
recognizes entries of this form: It looks for a corresponding bibtex entry with
key "xyz", and applies a set of changes described by the "PATCH" entry.

The "xyz.PATCH" entries are specified just like normal bibtex entries and can
appear in any of the bibtex sources specified in the bibolamazi file.

You can also selectively apply different sets of patches, identified by a "patch
series".  See below.

EXAMPLE:

Suppose our database has following the entry:

    @article{Einstein1935_EPR,
    author = {Einstein, Albert and Podolsky, Boris and Rosen, Nathan},
    doi = {10.1103/PhysRev.47.777},
    journal = {Physical Review},
    month = {may},
    number = {10},
    pages = {777--780},
    title = {Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality
             Be Considered Complete?},
    volume = {47},
    year = {1935}
    }

Now suppose we also have an entry, perhaps in a different source bibtex file, as
follows:

    @article{Einstein1935_EPR.PATCH,  % patch the Einsten1935EPR entry
    !type = {misc}                    % change bibtex entry type
    -doi = {},                        % remove "doi" field
    month = {May},                    % set "month" (replace)
    +note = {this is a cool paper}    % set "note" (append)
    }

After running the `apply_patches' filter, the Einstein1935_EPR.PATCH entry is
removed from the database, and the original Einstein1935_EPR entry becomes

    @misc{Einstein1935_EPR,
    author = {Einstein, Albert and Podolsky, Boris and Rosen, Nathan},
    journal = {Physical Review},
    month = {May},
    number = {10},
    pages = {777--780},
    title = {Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality
             Be Considered Complete?},
    volume = {47},
    year = {1935},
    note = {this is a cool paper}
    }

Note that the type was changed to "misc", the doi field was removed, the month
was changed to the capitalized version, and the note field was added.

PATCH SYNTAX REFERENCE:

The PATCH entry is read and parsed as a normal entry, but is interpreted
specially by the `apply_patches` filter as instructions of changes to perform on
a corresponding original bibtex entry.

fieldname = {...}

    Set the value of the given field to the new value.  If the field is already
    set, replace its value by the new one.

-fieldname = {}

    Remove the field from the entry entirely. The braces should be empty.

+fieldname = {...}

    Add the given field value to the existing field value.  If the field doesn't
    exist previously, set the field to this value.  If it does exist, then
    append this value using the separator specified by -sAddValueSeparator (by
    default, a comma and a space).

!type = {<new bibtex entry type>}

    Replace the bibtex entry type by the given type.  This is a special
    instruction that acts on the bibtex type instead of any field in particular.

PATCH SERIES:

If you have several patches, you can control when each patch is applied by
assigning them to different "patch series".  An instance of the 'apply_patches'
filter acts only on a given patch series.  Patches are associated to a patch
series by a suffix in the key, i.e.:

    @article{Einstein1935_EPR.PATCH.SERIESA,
    ...
    }

Would be associated with patch series "SERIESA".  To apply all patches from
"SERIESA", use:

    filter: apply_patches -sPatchSeries=SERIESA

No patch series suffix (i.e., a key like "Einstein1935_EPR.PATCH") corresponds
to the default patch series "" (the empty string).
